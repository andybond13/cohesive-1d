Required software:

Steps to run axisymmetricRing:

0. be in axisymmetricRing directory
1. get makefile to work on your system
2. edit simulation parameters in 'src/main.cpp'
3. remove compiled files: 'make clean'
4. make: 'make'
5. go to the results directory and clear it: 'cd results' & './clean.sh'
6. return to axisymmstricRing directory: 'cd ..'
7. run program: './bin/main.exe'

Steps to view results:
1. go to the result directory: 'cd results'
2. update plot.sh with browser or image viewer: 'vi plot.sh'
3. run plotter: './plot.sh'
4. view plots in browser or image viewer
5. view video with paraview (files in vtkFiles/ directory)
